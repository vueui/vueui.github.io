# The docs page for [Vue-UI](https://github.com/vueui/vue-ui)

The docs site is built using [Harp](https://www.npmjs.org/package/harp).

To build the docs locally:

* ```npm install -g harp```
* clone this repo
* run ```harp compile _docs ./```

Harp can also run a server to serve the docs locally. You can do that by running ```harp server _docs```.
The docs site will then be served at ```http://localhost:9000```
